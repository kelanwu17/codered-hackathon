#R-VISUAL
Conoco Philips Track

## Inspiration
In the oil & gas industry, researching data is difficult. Many databases and websites are often cluttered, unorganized, have an outdated appearance, and overall very difficult to understand. 

## What it does

This web application is designed to make it simpler for users to interact and analyze data from the oil & gas industry. You can research specifics through the dropdown sliders we created.
## How we built it

This project was built with python and flask for the back-end, and HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap for the front-end.
## Challenges we ran into

The most challenging parts during development were the implementation of the line graph and its functionalities, and the efficient extracting of data from the API.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Being able to implement the graph as we envisioned. Also just being able to complete this project and achieve all of the things we planned.

## What we learned

We learned a lot of technical skills. However, the most important things we learned, was how to collaborate as a team.

## What's next for R-Visual
We plan on implementing more data charts/graphs, being able to cover more specific areas in the industry, and adding more unique features beneficial to oil & gas researchers.
